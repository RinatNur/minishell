# Minishell
> This is a group project that i and my teammate wrudy had completed. The project is about coding our own shell that will work like the bash shell.

## Commands
bash builtins that are been implemented:

  * echo with option ’-n’
  * cd with only a relative or absolute path
  * pwd without any options
  * export without any options
  * unset without any options
  * env without any options and any arguments
  * exit without any options
  
* It supports redirections < > >>, pipes |, environment variables $, separation ; and strings as well "",''.
* It reacts on signals ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ as bash shell does.
